# A vulnerable app for Cyber Security base 2021: Project I -course

This repository has been created in order to complete the course Cyber Security base 2021: Project I. The task was to create at least 5 flaws from the OWASP Top 10 in an app. I chose the 2021 version of OWASP Top 10.

DO NOT USE THIS CODE! It is designed to contain security flaws.
